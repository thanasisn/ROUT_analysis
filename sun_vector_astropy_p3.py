    Args:
        lat (float):
            Latitude in degrees (WCS).

        lon (float):
            Longitude in degrees (WCS).

        date (datetime obj.):
            Date and time in UTC for the calculation

        pressure (float):
            Atmospheric pressure in bars at the location. This is necessary
            for performing refraction corrections. Setting this to 0
            (the default) will disable refraction calculations when
            transforming to/from this frame.

        temperature (float):
            The ground-level temperature as an Quantity in deg Celsius. This is
            necessary for performing refraction corrections.

        rel_humid (float):
            The relative humidity as a number from 0 to 1. This is necessary
            for performing refraction corrections.

    Returns:
        (sun_azimuth, sun_elevation, sun_distance) A tuple with
        the sun azimuth angle in decimal degrees from North,
        the sun elevation angle in decimal degrees from horizon
        sun distance in AU.
